Ameba - visualize searches differently
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1 (ameba): a static bubble chart based on http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269 to visualize search terms of a search application

v2 (Bubble my search): a nodejs application to collect search input from bubbles and then, make a search in a Solr Server. These bubbles have been implemented based on https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout
